        <strong>The Berry Last Straw</strong> takes you back to simpler times – the first grade lunch table and that first bite of your
        PB&amp;J specially made by Mom. This jam would make quite the stir at elementary lunch tables. At first bite you
        are greeted with farm fresh strawberries, which gives way to a delightful sweetness that is then brightened with
        the tang of key lime, making the perfect trifecta.</p>
    <p>Cowgirl Creamery’s Red Hawk, a washed rind cow’s milk cheese makes the perfect mate for
        <strong>The Berry Last Straw</strong>! Red Hawk is a dazzling little cheese with a supple buttery texture and perfectly delectable
        and funky flavor. The sweet strawberries love the funk in Red Hawk, and the limes help to cut through the fat and
        cream leading the eater to crave more. When eaten together this pairing is decadent, yet perfectly balanced. This
        would make for a satisfying dessert after a summer evening spent grilling.</p>
