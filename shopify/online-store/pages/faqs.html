    <strong>Why’s your jam “damn good?”</strong>
</p>
<p>Our jam is intensively flavorful. Seriously. Read our

    like fresh fruit!” because there were too many.) It tastes damn good because of both the

<p>
    <strong>Why’s your jam so expensive?</strong>
</p>
<p>First, since we don’t add pectin and use less sugar, each jar is jam-packed with more organic fruit. One 10 oz. jar of

<h3 class="uppercase">Product Questions</h3>
<br />
<p>
    <strong>How long is my jam good for unopened?</strong>
</p>
<p>The jam is best 2 years from when it was made but you’re completely safe to eat it after. We’ve hot-jarred them so they’re
    vacuum-sealed, which means no bacteria can grow in the jars (so dig in!). There’s no need to store them in the fridge
    until you open them.</p>
<br />
<p>
    <strong>How long will my jam last once I open it?</strong>
</p>
<p>Once opened, your jam is good for several months. The best way to extend the life of your jam is to take what you need from
    your jar and then put it back in the fridge. Keeping the jar out at room temperature will encourage spoilage (and we
    don’t want that!).</p>
<br />
<p>
    <strong>Since you don’t add pectin, will the jam spoil more quickly?</strong>
</p>
<p>No – pectin is naturally occurring in fruit and is activated by heat. There’s no need to add pectin, it’s just a thickener.
    Sugar is actually the natural preservative in jam. We have to work a little harder to make jams without added pectin
    – to coax it out naturally from the fruit – but we think it’s worth it for the intensity of flavor.</p>
<br />
<p>
    <strong>I can’t open my jar – what should I do?</strong>
</p>
<p>Pour a couple inches of water in a small pot, place it on the stove and turn the heat to high. Turn off the heat when it
    reaches a boil. Submerge your jar upside down just past the lid for 3 minutes. Remove it, dry it, and twist off the lid
    with a towel or dishwashing gloves to get some traction and prevent burns.</p>

<h3 class="uppercase">Ingredients</h3>
<br />
<strong>What kind of sugar or sweetener do you use?
    <br /> </strong>
<p>
    <br />We use Fairtrade, organic, unrefined cane sugar from Paraguay. Down the line we’d love to explore supporting other countries
    and communities. Read more about our work with sustainability

        </a>
    </span>.</p>
<br />
<p>
    <strong>How local is your fruit?</strong>
</p>
<p>Our fruit is from within 200 miles with the exception of our Meyer Lemons. They are about 400 miles. We would like them to
    be more local but we found the most amazing grove and we think the flavor quality is worth traveling a little farther
    for.</p>
<br />
<p>
    <strong>Is your jam gluten-free and vegan?</strong>
</p>
<p>Our jam is vegan and gluten-free but it’s not made in a gluten-free facility. We work in a shared facility but we use all
    our own equipment, which has not touched gluten.</p>
<br />
