<p>Take two classics – thumbprint cookies and peanut butter &amp; jelly – put them together and you have a hit on your hands.
    We recommend Razzle Bazzle or The Berry Last Straw as traditional pairings but Apricot up in the Moment or To Peach His Own
    are also great. Best enjoyed with a glass of cold milk.</p>

    <strong>Yield</strong>: 40 cookies
    <br />
    <strong>Active Time</strong>: 20 minutes
    <br />
    <strong>Total Time</strong>: 65 minutes + chilling time</p>
<strong>Ingredients</strong>:
<ul>
    <li>½ cup unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
    <li>⅓ cup granulated sugar</li>
    <li>⅓ cup firmly packed light brown sugar</li>
    <li>¾ cup creamy peanut butter</li>
    <li>1 extra-large egg, at room temperature</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon baking powder</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon sea salt flakes</li>
    <li>1 cup roasted red-skinned peanuts</li>
    <li>1 cup
        <strong>Jamnation</strong>
    </li>
</ul>
<strong>Preparation</strong>:
<ol>
    <li>Use beater to mix the butter and both sugars on medium until the butter is light and airy, 3-4 minutes. Add peanut butter
        and mix on medium until thoroughly combined. Add the egg and vanilla to the butter mixture and mix until the batter
        starts to resemble cottage cheese.</li>
    <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and both salts.</li>
    <li>Add the dry ingredients all at once to the butter mixture and mix on low until the dough comes together but still looks
        shaggy, 20 to 30 seconds.</li>
    <li>Stretch out a long sheet of plastic wrap onto a work surface and place the dough on top. Pat the dough into a 6-by-8-inch
        rectangle and wrap dough with plastic wrap. Chill in the fridge for at least 2 hours or up to 3 days.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350°. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
    <li>In a food processor, pulse the nuts just until they are finely ground.</li>
    <li>Cut the dough lengthwise into 5 even strips. Roll the strips back and forth into logs to round out the edges and each
        log is about 9” long. Coat each log in ground nuts.</li>
    <li>Cut each log into 8 equal pieces. Roll each piece in ground nuts again to round out the edges, then place the pieces
        cut-side up on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
    <li>With the tip of your thumb, make an indentation into the center of each cookie and slightly flatten the cookie. Spoon
        your favorite
        <strong>Jamnation</strong> into the center of each thumbprint.</li>
    <li>Bake for 14 minutes, until the cookies begin to crack a bit on the top and are just set.</li>
