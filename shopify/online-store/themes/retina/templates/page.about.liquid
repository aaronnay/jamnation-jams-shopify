  <h2>Gillian Reynolds</h2>
  <h5 class="uppercase">Founder/Chief Jammer</h5>
  <p>
    Jamnation, made in SF by Gillian Reynolds, celebrates exquisite fruit, with a focus on sustainability &amp; superior ingredients.
    On a trip to Brazil in 2013, the simple fruits she tasted from small, local farms exploded with flavors that blew her away.
    Returning to SF, she sought out the same intensity of flavor in local organic fruit from small Northern California farms.
    Her desire to share these exquisite fruits with friends &amp; family in NYC inspired her to create artisanal jams that are bright, bold &amp; meticulously paired.
    A Stanford economics major, she was struck by the impact of global trade on farmers in developing countries hence, all products use Fairtrade sugar + spices.
